# Looking for these people
Here are some folks from my past that I would like to hear from but cannot find.

## John Sfiris
Johnny Sfiris was the Land Mobile Radio repair contractor at Hellenikon Air Base, Greece, in 1985. He was building a home on the Peloponese back then.

## John, Georgia, and Irene Papadopoulos
John, Georgia, and Irene were our neighbors in Ano Glyfada, Greece, in 1985. They were related to the building owner, who had spent a lot of time in Australia prior to coming back to Greece, working at Olympic Airlines, and building our apartment building. John and Georgia were married and Irene was their infant daughter.
